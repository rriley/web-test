# Teaching

Teaching is my real passion, and the reason I finally decided to get a PhD. (Donâ€™t get me wrong, I do enjoy my research, but teaching is what gets me really excited.)
You should check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZy1TmqIMQ4perExQerm5bQ) for a variety of videos I've put together for various courses I've taught.
