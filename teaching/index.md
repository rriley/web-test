#Teaching

Teaching is my real passion, and the reason I finally decided to get a PhD. (Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy my research, but teaching is what gets me really excited.)

## Courses
Normally I would have links to the course websites for courses I’ve taught, but now that Blackboard is becoming the mandated online-course system for QU, I don’t get that option anymore.  I plan to put more things here in time.

## Senior Design
If you are a QU student interested in having me supervise your Senior Design Project, visit [this page](/teaching/senior.html) for details.

## Thesis Supervision
If you are Master's in Computing student in QU, [here](/teaching/thesis.html) is a page about projects I'm currently a part of that you could join to do your Master's Thesis.
