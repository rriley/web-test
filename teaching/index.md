#Teaching

Teaching is my real passion, and the reason I finally decided to get a PhD. (Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy my research, but teaching is what gets me really excited.)

Normally I would have links to the course websites for courses I’ve taught, but now that Blackboard is becoming the mandated online-course system for QU, I don’t get that option anymore.  I plan to put more things here in time.
