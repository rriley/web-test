#Senior Design

Here at Qatar University every Professor in the department supervises one senior design team per year. Starting in the Spring semesters, students start to look for an advisor for their project in the next year.

If you would like me to consider supervising your project, there are some things you should know:

 * The project is your project, and you will be the driving force. I will **not** choose your project, assign you tasks, or write/edit your documentation. The project is entirely **yours**.
 * My role is to provide supervision, advice, guidance, and expertise. That means I would love to help answer questions and give you guidance about how to proceed. I want to walk with you as you learn and help you whenever I can.
 * I’m not easy. You will have to work. For a senior design project, I expect each student to put in about 12 hours per week on the project (on average). Some weeks will be much less, some weeks will be much more.
 * I want the project to be fun for you and for me. Programming an interesting application for an Android phone is fun. Designing a scaleable internet based app is fun. Analyzing the security of something is fun. Writing a java program that no one will ever use and that you hate is not fun.

Here is a list of topics that I find interesting recently, maybe they interest you, too.

 * Mobile phone applications
 * The security of QU's network
 * Virtualization
 * Using microprocessors for security
 * Creative applications of Microsoft’s Kinect peripheral. [Examples](http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/12/07/videos-the-best-kinect-hacks-and-mods-one-month-in/).
 * Devices built around a [Raspberry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

In order for me to consider being your supervisor, your team needs to put together a 1-page proposal for your project. This should include:

 * Is this a Computer Science or Computer Engineering topic?
 * Name and Student ID of every team member.
 * 100-300 word description of the project you would like to do.

If you don’t know what you want to do, I'm more than willing to meet with you and talk about some of my and your interests.
