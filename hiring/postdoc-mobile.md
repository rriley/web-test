##Why would I go to Qatar?

Qatar’s capital, Doha, is an up-and-coming modern city with easy access to the world. Qatar is a small country on the East coast of the Arabian peninsula. Its abundant reserves of natural gas have resulted in it having a GDP per capita among the highest in the world. It is cosmopolitan, vibrant, yet pleasant and safe. And of course, it was recently selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

The position in Qatar offers a competitive, tax-free salary (~$50,000 per year), health insurance, and additional financial allowances for housing, transportation, travel, and children’s schooling. The position comes with support for conferences and equipment. Postdocs are encouraged to explore research ideas on top of and beyond the project description. The position provides significant opportunities for professional development.
